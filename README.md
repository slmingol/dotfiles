This is really mostly just for me... Feel free to take what you want though.

The general idea is as follows:
* Install `zsh`
* Install `vim`
* Clone this repo
* `cd` into the folder

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
./install.sh
```

If you have trouble:
* `rm -r .vim` if the vim settings aren't working well.
